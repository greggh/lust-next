## Getting Started

### Launching the CLI

The Interactive CLI can be launched using the main Firmo module:

```lua
local firmo = require("firmo")
local interactive = require("lib.tools.interactive")

-- Start the interactive CLI
interactive.start(firmo)
```

When launched, you'll see a welcome screen and prompt:

```
Firmo Interactive CLI
Type 'help' for available commands
------------------------------------------------------------
> 
```

### Initial Configuration

Before starting, you can configure the CLI with options:

```lua
interactive.configure({
  test_dir = "tests/unit",
  test_pattern = "*_test.lua",
  watch_mode = false,
  colorized_output = true
})

interactive.start(firmo)
```

## Basic Commands

The CLI provides several basic commands:

### Help

Display available commands:

```
> help
```

### Status

Show current settings:

```
> status
```

Example output:

```
Current settings:
  Test directory:     ./tests
  Test pattern:       *_test.lua
  Focus filter:       none
  Tag filter:         none
  Watch mode:         disabled
  Codefix:            disabled
  Available tests:    24
------------------------------------------------------------
```

### List Test Files

Display available test files:

```
> list
```

Example output:

```
Available test files:
  1. tests/core/config_test.lua
  2. tests/core/lifecycle_test.lua
  3. tests/tools/filesystem_test.lua
  ...
------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Clear Screen

Clear the terminal screen:

```
> clear
```

### Exit

Exit the interactive CLI:

```
> exit
```

or

```
> quit
```

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

Run all discovered test files:

```
> run
```

### Run Specific Test File

Run a single test file by name or path:

```
> run tests/core/config_test.lua
```

You can also run a file by its number from the list:

```
> run 1
```

### Setting Test Directory

Change the test directory:

```
> dir tests/unit
```

This will update the test directory and rediscover test files.

### Setting Test Pattern

Change the pattern used to find test files:

```
> pattern *_spec.lua
```

This will update the test file pattern and rediscover test files.

## Filtering Tests

The interactive CLI offers several ways to filter which tests are run.

### Filter by Name

Filter tests by name pattern:

```
> filter string_utils
```

This will only run tests whose descriptions match "string_utils".

To clear the filter:

```
> filter
```

### Focus on Specific Tests

Focus on a specific test or group:

```
> focus "should validate input"
```

This will only run tests that match the given description.

To clear the focus:

```
> focus
```

### Filter by Tags

Filter tests by tag:

```
> tags unit,fast
```

This will only run tests that have both "unit" and "fast" tags.

To clear tag filters:

```
> tags
```

## Watch Mode

Watch mode monitors files for changes and automatically reruns tests when changes are detected.

### Enable/Disable Watch Mode

Toggle watch mode:

```
> watch
```

Or explicitly enable/disable:

```
> watch on
> watch off
```

### Configure Watch Directories

Add directories to watch:

```
> watch-dir src
```

If you add more than one, all will be watched:

```
> watch-dir lib
> watch-dir tests
```

### Exclude Patterns

Add patterns to exclude from watching:

```
> watch-exclude node_modules
> watch-exclude %.git
```

### Using Watch Mode

Once in watch mode:

1. Tests will run automatically when files change
2. The screen will clear and show which files changed
3. Press Enter to return to the interactive prompt

Example watch mode session:

```
--- WATCHING FOR CHANGES (Press Enter to return to interactive mode) ---

File changes detected:
  - src/utils/string_utils.lua

--- RUNNING TESTS ---
2025-03-26 10:45:23

Running tests/utils/string_utils_test.lua
✓ Suite: String Utils
  ✓ should trim whitespace
  ✓ should capitalize first letter
  ✓ should handle empty string

3 passing (0.003s)

--- WATCHING FOR CHANGES (Press Enter to return to interactive mode) ---
```

## Code Quality with Codefix

The interactive CLI integrates with the codefix module to provide code quality checks and fixes.

### Check Code

Check code for issues without modifying files:

```
> codefix check src
```

### Fix Code

Fix code quality issues:

```
> codefix fix src
```

The codefix command supports all the capabilities of the codefix module, including StyLua formatting and Luacheck linting.

## Command History

### View History

Show previously entered commands:

```
> history
```

Example output:

```
Command History:
  1. run
  2. filter string_utils
  3. watch on
  4. watch off
  5. codefix check src
```

### Navigate History

Use Up and Down arrow keys to navigate through command history.

## Configuration Tips

### Optimal Workflow Configuration

For the best development workflow, configure the CLI as follows:

```lua
interactive.configure({
  test_dir = "tests",
  test_pattern = "*_test.lua",
  watch_mode = true,
  watch_dirs = { "src", "tests" },
  exclude_patterns = { "node_modules", "%.git", "%.vscode" },
  watch_interval = 0.5,
  colorized_output = true
})
```

This configuration:
- Watches both source and test files
- Excludes common directories that shouldn't trigger test runs
- Uses a faster check interval (0.5 seconds)
- Enables colorized output for better readability

### Using Central Configuration

If your project uses central_config, you can set interactive CLI options there:

```lua
local central_config = require("lib.core.central_config")

central_config.set("interactive", {
  test_dir = "tests",
  watch_mode = true,
  watch_dirs = { "src", "tests" },
  exclude_patterns = { "node_modules", "%.git" }
})
```

The interactive CLI will automatically use these settings.

## Integration with Other Tools

### CI/CD Integration

For continuous integration pipelines, you can use the interactive CLI in non-interactive mode:

```lua
-- Run all tests programmatically
local firmo = require("firmo")
local interactive = require("lib.tools.interactive")

interactive.configure({
  test_dir = "tests",
  test_pattern = "*_test.lua"
})

local test_files = firmo.discover_tests("tests", "*_test.lua")
local success = firmo.run_all(test_files)

if not success then
  os.exit(1)
end
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

You can use the interactive CLI in pre-commit hooks to ensure tests pass before committing:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# pre-commit hook

lua -e 'require("lib.tools.interactive").run_pre_commit()'
```

With a corresponding Lua function:

```lua
function interactive.run_pre_commit()
  local firmo = require("firmo")
  
  interactive.configure({
    test_dir = "tests",
    test_pattern = "*_test.lua",
    colorized_output = true
  })
  
  local test_files = firmo.discover_tests("tests", "*_test.lua")
  local success = firmo.run_all(test_files)
  
  if not success then
    print("Tests failed, commit aborted")
    os.exit(1)
  end
  
  print("All tests passed")
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Tests Not Being Found

If tests aren't being discovered:

```
> status
```

Check that the test directory and pattern are correct. If not, update them:

```
> dir tests
> pattern *_test.lua
```

Then list tests to verify:

```
> list
```

#### Watch Mode Not Detecting Changes

If watch mode isn't detecting changes, check:

1. That you're modifying files in the watched directories
2. That the files aren't excluded by patterns
3. The watch interval may be too long

You can adjust these settings:

```
> watch-dir src
> watch-exclude node_modules
```

#### Colorized Output Issues

If colorized output looks strange in your terminal:

```
> configure colorized_output false
```

#### CLI Not Responding

If the CLI stops responding:

1. Press Ctrl+C to exit
2. Restart with different options
3. Check if another process is consuming system resources

### Getting Help

For detailed error information, enable debug mode:

```lua
interactive.configure({
  debug = true,
  verbose = true
})
```

This will provide more detailed logging information to help diagnose issues.
