# CI/CD Integration with Firmo
This guide explains how to set up Firmo in various Continuous Integration (CI) environments to automate your Lua testing workflow.

## Benefits of CI Integration

- Automatically run tests on every commit or pull request
- Catch issues early in the development process
- Ensure code quality across your team
- Generate test reports for tracking quality metrics

## Common CI Systems

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

#### Sample Configuration
Create a file at `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

```yaml
name: Lua Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Firmo Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Lua
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y lua5.3

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          # Run all tests in the tests directory
          lua test.lua tests/

      - name: Generate test report (optional)
        run: |
          # If using a reporter/formatter
          lua test.lua tests/ --reporter junit > test-results.xml

      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: test-results.xml

```

### GitLab CI
GitLab CI/CD is GitLab's built-in tool for software development using continuous integration and delivery.

#### Sample Configuration
Create a file at `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
image: ubuntu:latest
stages:

  - test
before_script:

  - apt-get update -qq
  - apt-get install -y lua5.3
run_tests:
  stage: test
  script:

    - lua test.lua tests/
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:

      - test-results.xml
    reports:
      junit: test-results.xml

```

### CircleCI
CircleCI is a CI/CD platform that automates the build, test, and deployment process.

#### Sample Configuration
Create a file at `.circleci/config.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  test:
    docker:

      - image: cimg/base:2023.03
    steps:

      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Lua
          command: |
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y lua5.3

      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: |
            lua test.lua tests/

      - store_test_results:
          path: test-results
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-test:
    jobs:

      - test

```

### Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software.

#### Sample Jenkinsfile
Create a file at `Jenkinsfile`:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Setup') {
            steps {
                sh 'apt-get update && apt-get install -y lua5.3'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'lua test.lua tests/'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'test-results.xml'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## Best Practices for CI Testing

### 1. Organize Tests Properly
Structure your tests in a way that makes them easy to run in CI:

- Place all tests in a dedicated `tests` directory
- Use a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `*_test.lua`)
- Group tests logically by feature or component

### 2. Use Tags for Test Organization

```lua
describe("Database module", function()
  firmo.tags("integration", "database")
  it("connects to the database", function()
    -- Test code
  end)
end)

```
In your CI configuration, you can run specific test groups:

```bash
lua test.lua tests/ --tags unit  # Run only unit tests
lua test.lua tests/ --tags integration  # Run only integration tests

```

### 3. Manage Test Environments
For tests that require specific environment setup:

```yaml

# In GitHub Actions
steps:

  - name: Set up test environment
    run: |
      # Set environment variables
      echo "DB_HOST=localhost" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      echo "API_KEY=test-key" >> $GITHUB_ENV

  - name: Run integration tests
    run: |
      lua test.lua tests/ --tags integration

```

### 4. Configure Test Timeouts
For long-running tests, set appropriate timeouts:

```yaml

# In GitHub Actions
steps:

  - name: Run tests with timeout
    timeout-minutes: 10
    run: |
      lua test.lua tests/

```

### 5. Parallel Test Execution
For large test suites, consider running tests in parallel:

```yaml

# In GitHub Actions
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test-group: [unit, integration, functional]
    steps:

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          lua test.lua tests/ --tags ${{ matrix.test-group }}

```

## Interpreting Test Results
Firmo provides different output formats to help you interpret test results in CI environments.

### Standard Output
By default, Firmo outputs test results to the console:

```
Math operations
  PASS adds two numbers correctly
  PASS subtracts two numbers correctly
  FAIL raises an error when dividing by zero
    Expected function to fail but it did not

```

### JUnit XML Format (For CI Systems)
For better CI integration, use the JUnit XML reporter:

```bash
lua test.lua tests/ --reporter junit > test-results.xml

```
This generates an XML file that most CI systems can parse and display as test reports.

### JSON Format (For Custom Processing)
For custom processing of test results:

```bash
lua test.lua tests/ --reporter json > test-results.json

```

## Tips for Effective CI Configuration

1. **Cache dependencies**: Speed up CI runs by caching Lua modules and dependencies.
1. **Fail fast**: Configure your tests to fail as soon as any test fails to get faster feedback.
1. **Notifications**: Set up notifications for test failures to relevant team members.
1. **Branch protection**: Require passing tests before merging pull requests.
1. **Scheduled runs**: Set up scheduled test runs for nightly builds or integration tests.

## Complete Example: GitHub Actions Workflow
This comprehensive example shows a complete GitHub Actions workflow for testing a Lua project with Firmo:

```yaml
name: Lua Testing
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  schedule:
    # Run nightly at midnight UTC

    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
jobs:
  test:
    name: Lua ${{ matrix.lua-version }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        lua-version: ['5.1', '5.2', '5.3', '5.4', 'luajit']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Lua
        uses: xpol/setup-lua@v0.3
        with:
          lua-version: ${{ matrix.lua-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          luarocks install luafilesystem
          luarocks install luasocket

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: lua test.lua tests/ --tags unit --reporter junit > unit-test-results.xml

      - name: Run integration tests
        if: success() || failure() # Run even if unit tests fail
        run: lua test.lua tests/ --tags integration --reporter junit > integration-test-results.xml

      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-results-${{ matrix.lua-version }}-${{ matrix.os }}
          path: |
            *-test-results.xml

```
