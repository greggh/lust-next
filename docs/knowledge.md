## Core Principles

1. NO DEBUG HOOKS - The v3 coverage system must never use debug hooks (debug.sethook). All coverage tracking must be done through source code instrumentation.

2. Three-State Coverage - The system must properly distinguish between:
   - Covered (green): Code verified by assertions
   - Executed (orange): Code that ran but wasn't verified
   - Not covered (red): Code that didn't run

3. No Special Cases - All solutions must be general purpose without special handling for specific files

4. Clean Abstractions - Components must interact through well-defined interfaces

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use the parser in lib/tools/parser/grammar.lua for parsing Lua code

2. Use source code instrumentation to track coverage:
   - Parse source into AST
   - Transform AST to add tracking
   - Generate instrumented code
   - Create source map

3. Use central_config for all configuration

4. Handle errors consistently using error_handler

5. Use structured logging with the logging module

## Testing Requirements

After every change:
1. Run tests: `lua test.lua tests/`
2. Check coverage: `lua test.lua --coverage tests/`
3. Validate types: `lua test.lua --types`

## Common Issues

1. Debug hooks are unreliable and cannot properly track coverage - use instrumentation instead

2. The parser may need high stack size for complex code - use lpeg.setmaxstack(1000)

3. Source maps are critical for error reporting - always maintain accurate source maps
