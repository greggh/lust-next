    Filesystem - Platform-independent file and directory operations module
    
    A comprehensive, standalone filesystem module for Lua with minimal dependencies.
    This module provides a consistent, cross-platform interface for file and directory
    operations with robust error handling, path manipulation capabilities, and discovery
    functions.
    
    Features:
    - File operations: read, write, append, copy, move, delete
    - Directory operations: create, delete, list, scan recursively
    - Path manipulation: join, normalize, get components
    - File discovery: pattern matching, glob support, recursive search
    - File metadata: size, timestamps, existence checks
    - Error handling: consistent nil/error return pattern
    - Platform independence: works on Windows, macOS, Linux
    
    Design principles:
    - Complete independence: Minimal imports from other modules
    - Generic interface: All functions usable in any Lua project
    - Minimal dependencies: Only relies on Lua standard library
    - Platform neutral: Works identically on all platforms
    - Comprehensive error handling: All functions return nil/error pairs on failure
    - Cross-version compatibility: Works with Lua 5.1+ and LuaJIT

--- Detect if running on Windows operating system

--- Safely execute an I/O operation with error handling
--- This utility function wraps I/O operations in a pcall to catch errors,
--- provides consistent error handling, and filters out common permission
--- denied errors to avoid flooding logs. All filesystem module functions
--- should use this wrapper for consistent error handling.
---
--- @private
--- @generic T

--- @param ... any Additional arguments to pass to the action function
--- @return T|nil result The result of the action function or nil on error
--- @return string|nil error An error message if the action failed

--- This function moves a file from one location to another. It first attempts
